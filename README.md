**Update:** End of August 2013, Commonwealth bank upgraded their netbank interfaces and removed their old wap versio which I was using.
So now this does not work anymore. As far as I can tell, there is no netbank interface that works without Javascript anymore, so it will be much harder to parse their code.

I'll keep this repo up for reference.
